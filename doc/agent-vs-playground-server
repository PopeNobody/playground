## Know your interfaces!

An agent is similar to an HTTP User Agent, except it does not
sepak HTTP.

It is lighter weight that a playground server.  While the plground
server holds a conversation, and speaks http, an Agent speaks a
simple tcp/ip protocol, and does not have a conversation.  All it
does is take one message from the user as a flat file ( not json )
and pass it on to the Playground.

The Playground is a server to the Agent and a client to the provider.
The Agent is a server ( or interface to the server ) to the user,
and a client to the Playground.

Hope that helps.  I wrote this down because I kept goign "what the fuck?"
