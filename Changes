2025-03-08 19:00:01 [ea58264] nobody: Simple test question:  please answer
    with exactly 'Test response'

Software testing doesn't have to be boring, you just have to do it

whimsically.  Test is going to ai for some reason when it should be

mocked, so I'm going to capture the conversation, and send him a

followup question to see if he can tell me why the code is mocking

me by not mocking the object.

committing this for posterity, 'cause I think it's hilarious.

+#  show AI code of test, so he understand the need for precision.

+#  kinda funny, feels like cheating, but all's fair in love and code

+#  I don't really know why this test is going to a real ai, thought

+#  it was being mocked.  but such is life.  I'll find this conversation

+#  in the test results, and send him a followup question, just because

+#  that's so much more fun than tracking it down.  :)

+#

+#  This is all just so meta, I almost feel like I should send it to Meta,

+#  but I don't have the code for that yet.

use AI::Msg::as_json to format msgs.

  * let messages format themselves

  * overload stringify operator to throw exception

    for debugging.

diff --git a/t/00-load.t b/t/00-load.t

  * test load MIME::Types

diff --git a/t/01-textproc.t b/t/01-textproc.t

diff --git a/t/02-msg.t b/t/02-msg.t

  * replace newlines with spaces in results of some

    messages, to prevent even wrapping with short lines

    breaking tests.

diff --git a/t/03-conv.t b/t/03-conv.t

  * Don't stringify Msg, it happens accidentally too frequently

    so it may be modified to throw exception during development

diff --git a/t/04-serialPath.t b/t/04-serialPath.t

  * Make proper names, without spaces

  * if file creation fails with !$!{EEXIST}, throw the error

  * only increment iterator if ${EEXIST}.  let the next call

    iterate once, to avoid losing "address space" in the event

    of other errors

  * report errors with confess

  * create files in testing tempdir ( t/tmp )

diff --git a/t/05-mimetypes.t b/t/05-mimetypes.t

  * do not expect shebang after leading whitespace to fail.

    leading whitespace is eaten by transact code.

diff --git a/lib/AI/Conv.pm b/lib/AI/Conv.pm

use AI::Msg::as_json to format msgs.

  * let messages format themselves

  * overload stringify operator to throw exception

    for debugging.

diff --git a/t/00-load.t b/t/00-load.t

  * test load MIME::Types

diff --git a/t/01-textproc.t b/t/01-textproc.t

diff --git a/t/02-msg.t b/t/02-msg.t

  * replace newlines with spaces in results of some

    messages, to prevent even wrapping with short lines

    breaking tests.

diff --git a/t/03-conv.t b/t/03-conv.t

  * Don't stringify Msg, it happens accidentally too frequently

    so it may be modified to throw exception during development

diff --git a/t/04-serialPath.t b/t/04-serialPath.t

  * Make proper names, without spaces

  * if file creation fails with !$!{EEXIST}, throw the error

  * only increment iterator if ${EEXIST}.  let the next call

    iterate once, to avoid losing "address space" in the event

    of other errors

  * report errors with confess

  * create files in testing tempdir ( t/tmp )

diff --git a/t/05-mimetypes.t b/t/05-mimetypes.t

  * do not expect shebang after leading whitespace to fail.

    leading whitespace is eaten by transact code.
